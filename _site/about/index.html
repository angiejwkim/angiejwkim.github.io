	<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Angie! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I was born in Seoul and immigrated to Vancouver at the age of 2. Iâ€™m now a junior at <a href="http://brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, where I study applied math (with a hint of computer science). My academic interests lie broadly in dynamical systems, climate models and policy, and machine learning.</p>

<p>Outside of my coursework, I do research as part of Professor Timmons Robertsâ€™ <a href="http://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/">Climate and Development Lab</a>, Iâ€™ve been a teaching assistant for four courses, and I lead weekly campus tours. I spent 5 semesters on the Editorial Board of the <a href="http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/category/mag/">Brown Political Review</a>, the last 2 of which I served as Senior Managing Editor.</p>

<p>I came to Brown thinking I was never going to take a math class again, did my fair share of exploring and hopping around departments for my first two years, and I finally feel a little settled. Not only that, but Iâ€™ve also found that what Iâ€™ve been interested over the course of my life - computers, math, climate, and policy - have reemerged to become big parts of who I am today.</p>

<p>Though I donâ€™t have clear career plans, I hope to end up in a role where I can leverage my quantitative background for social impact. Iâ€™m currently an officer for <a href="http://cssc.cs.brown.edu/">CS for Social Change</a> at Brown, where Iâ€™m learning more about how I can do this.</p>

<p>Next summer, Iâ€™ll be working at <a href="http://blackrock.com/">BlackRock</a> in New York as a software engineering intern in the Aladdin Product Group â€” Iâ€™m excited to hone my technical skills through this experience.</p>

<p>In my spare time, you can find me doing a crossword, half marathon training, working on projects (<a href="../projects">which you can learn more about here</a>!), or experimenting in the kitchen. Iâ€™m always looking for recommendations for books/articles to read, passionate individuals to connect with, and new coffee shops to love.</p>

<p>For more of me, feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejwkim/">LinkedIn</a> and find me lurking on <a href="http://twitter.com/angiejwkim">Twitter</a>. You can also reach me at angiejwkim at gmail dot com!</p>
