I'm Angie:
I was born in Seoul, moved to Vancouver at 2, and currently attend school in Providence, RI.
I'm a sophomore computer science student at Brown University. 
I like good food, crossword puzzles, and trivia.

I'm always [working on something](http://github.com/angiejwkim/), [cooking something](/whats-cooking/), or [figuring out where to go next](/places/).

Find me lurking on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/angiejwkim).
