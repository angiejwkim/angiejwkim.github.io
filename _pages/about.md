Hi, I'm Angie!


I was born in Seoul and immigrated to Vancouver at the age of 2. I'm now at [Brown University](http://brown.edu/), where I study applied math and computer science.


I'm also into politics, and I'm currently Senior Managing Editor at the [Brown Political Review](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/category/mag/). In the long term, I hope to end up somewhere I can merge my interests and use technology to promote social good. I'm currently an officer for [CS for Social Change](http://cssc.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown.


This summer, I'll be working in Brown's Biomedical AI Lab in partnership with the Rhode Island Hospital, using deep learning to create a database for gene fusion literature. See what I'm up to on [Github](http://github.com/angiejwkim/)!

In my spare time, you can find me doing a crossword, going for a run, or trying new recipes. I'm always looking for recommendations for books/articles to read and new coffee shops to love!


For more of me, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejwkim/) and find me lurking on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/angiejwkim). You can also reach me at [angiejwkim@gmail.com](mailto:angiejwkim@gmail.com).
