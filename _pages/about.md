Hi, I'm Angie! ðŸ‘‹

I was born in Seoul and immigrated to Vancouver at the age of 2. I'm now a rising senior at [Brown University](http://brown.edu/), where I study applied math (with a hint of computer science). My academic interests lie broadly in machine learning, dynamical systems, and climate models and policy.

I came to Brown thinking I was never going to take a math class again, did my fair share of exploring and hopping around departments for my first two years. Through this experience, what I've been interested over the course of my life - computers, math, climate, and politics - have reemerged to become big parts of who I am today.

This summer, I interned at [BlackRock](http://blackrock.com/) in New York as a software engineering intern in the Aladdin Product Group. I'm currently looking for full-time roles in software engineering or data science for 2020. 

My main academic focus for my last year is my honors thesis, which I'm working on with Professor [Stephen Bach](http://stephenbach.net). Outside of coursework, I've done research as part of Professor Timmons Roberts' [Climate and Development Lab](http://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/), I've been a teaching assistant for four courses, and I lead weekly campus tours. I spent 5 semesters on the Editorial Board of the [Brown Political Review](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/category/mag/), the last 2 of which I served as Senior Managing Editor.

In my spare time, you can find me doing a crossword, half marathon training, working on projects ([which you can learn more about here](../projects)!), or experimenting in the kitchen. I'm always looking for recommendations for books/articles to read, passionate individuals to connect with, and new coffee shops to love.
