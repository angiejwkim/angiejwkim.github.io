I was born in Seoul, Korea and grew up in Vancouver, Canada.  
I'm now in Providence, Rhode Island, where I study computer science at [Brown University](http://cs.brown.edu/).  
I'm particularly interested in security and data science.


I'm also into politics, and I help put together [Brown Political Review](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/category/mag/)'s magazine.  
I hope to end up somewhere I can merge my interests and use technology to promote social good.

 
In my spare time, you can find me doing a crossword, running, or watching Jeopardy.  
I'm always looking for recommendations for books/articles to read and new coffee shops to love!


Over winter break, I'm working on this website and tinkering with MATLAB in preparation for TAing [CS4](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs004/).  
See what I'm up to on [Github](http://github.com/angiejwkim/)!
