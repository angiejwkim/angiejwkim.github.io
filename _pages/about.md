Hi, I'm Angie! ðŸ‘‹

I was born in Seoul and immigrated to Vancouver at the age of 2. I'm now at [Brown University](http://brown.edu/), where I study applied math and computer science. My academic interests lie mainly in data science, machine learning, and security.

I'm also into politics: I'll be headed to DC this November with the [Climate and Development Lab](http://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/) to present research in environmental policy, and I'm currently Senior Managing Editor at the [Brown Political Review](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/category/mag/). 

Though I don't have clear career plans, I hope to end up somewhere I can leverage both my technical and people skills to promote social good. As an officer for [CS for Social Change](http://cssc.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown, I'm learning more about how I can make this happen.

This summer, I'm working in Brown's [Biomedical AI Lab](https://www.brown.edu/Research/AI/research/) in partnership with the Rhode Island Hospital, using deep learning to create a database for gene fusion literature. See what I'm up to - for work and for other projects - on [Github](http://github.com/angiejwkim/)!

In my spare time, you can find me doing a crossword, half marathon training, or experimenting in the kitchen. I'm always looking for recommendations for books/articles to read, passionate individuals to connect with, and new coffee shops to love!

For more of me, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejwkim/) and find me lurking on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/angiejwkim). You can also reach me at [angiejwkim@gmail.com](mailto:angiejwkim@gmail.com).
